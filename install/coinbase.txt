SITE is the base URL of your website and SECRET can be any random string you choose.
Modify other merchant settings as needed. Leave the success and cancel URLs blank.
Next go to the Merchant Profile tab and fill out your details.
Then hover over your email address in the top right, and click User Settings.
In the API tab, click New API Key, enable the merchant and orders permissions, and click Create.
